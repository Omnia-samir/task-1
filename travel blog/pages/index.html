            <p>Posted on " 19/8/2024 "</p>
            <p>Last week, I had the amazing opportunity to visit Rome. Here are some highlights:</p>

                <h2>" 1.Colosseum "</h2> 
                <p>" The number 1 attraction of Rome is the Colosseum; the large amphitheatre that housed 65,000 spectators in Roman days.
                    Gladiators battled each other as well as wild animals in the Colosseum's arena, which is considered one of the seven modern wonders of the world.
                    In the giant ‘ruins’ of the Colosseum, you can visit the stands, the arena and the underground spaces of the largest Roman amphitheatre. "

                <h2>" 2.Trevi Fountain of Rome "</h2> 
                <p>The most famous fountain in the capital of Italy and perhaps even the world must be the ‘Fontana di Trevi’, or Trevi Fountain.
                    This baroque fountain, located on the Piazza di Trevi, was built in the 18th century. The landmark and monument displays the god of the sea, Neptune on his chariot.
                    No visit or Rome sightseeing is complete without tossing a coin in the Trevi Fountain, as this means the person throwing the coin will ‘one day return to Rome Italy’.
